# snowball-strategy - an OpenAI GPT-3 snowball fight strategy simulator

this web experience simulates the thoughts and strategies of participants in a snow fight

this will almost definitely NOT work on your mobile device. use a desktop browser.

to get started, drag at least 2 images from the palette on the left to the snow arena on the right 
then click the button at the top and wait a bit

under the hood, these messages are generated by
  1. programatically creating a structured data prompt, including information about the protagonist, their situation, and the location of people and objects in their environment
  2. feeding this prompt to OpenAI's GPT-3 model API's Completion endpoint
  3. displaying the response in a cute screen

the images were all generated using OpenAI's DALL-E; "let it snow" track by me

README in the app folder has instructions for building
